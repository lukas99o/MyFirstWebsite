            <p>
                Hello! My name is Lukas Olsson, and I live in Stockholm, Sweden, with my girlfriend and our cat. My interest in programming began two years ago with a challenging but inspiring attempt to create my own video game. This experience taught me the complexities of game development and led me to pursue programming more seriously. I started learning the basics through FreeCodeCamp, where I was introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Currently, I am enrolled in a full-stack .NET program at Chas Academy in Stockholm, where I am deepening my knowledge and skills in software development. I look forward to completing my studies in June 2025. The journey has been enriching, steadily building my abilities to bring creative ideas to fruition through coding.
